<body>
    <P>Describing myself is one of the toughest task to do, but it is fascinating too, to put it to words. I believe our traits be they positive or negative make us the person we are to the world. when it comes to my personality, people can have different opinions because they see what they want to see in me, and thats okay, so, I would describe myself from the paradign I see myself from in different aspect.</P> 
    <p>As a person, I believe life is an art and I am the artist of my life. I try to keep it full of colours and as cheerful as possible no matter what life throws at me. I am an ethusiast and a person full of curios. Curious to know what life is all about and what it holds in the future. </p>
    <p>I like to keep a smile on my face no matter what I am going through, and that smile keeps me going. Besides, I was brought up ion a multicultural community. Therefore I am an extrovert, and I like to meet people, I love to experience their lives, cultures, and traditions, which makes me happy and cheerful.</p> 
    <p>Moreover I am reliable but very short tempered. I lose calm if not understood properly. I get very irritated internally, but that doesnt show in my behaviour. However, I would like to change this character trait a little because my friends and dear ones often do not notice that I have some troubles, thus they do not offer help when I need it. </p> 
    <p>Good or bad, this is me, trying to contemplate the world as it is, revealing its true colors. I believe life is a gift, and it should be treated like one, with love, care and respect. @Judish diary. </p>
